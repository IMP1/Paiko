Taken from the [official website](http://www.paikogame.com/),
> Built to draw out the best of your intuition and tactical skill, Paiko pits you in a 
> one-on-one duel to out-build, out-position and out-maneuver your opponent with its 
> new style of turn-based strategy. Paiko is less daunting than chess but has more grit 
> than checkers, and in play feels a bit like Japanese chess meets Chinese checkers. As 
> you play, you'll find Paiko creates an engaging tactical drama with enough clarity to 
> let you create your own play style, and enough depth to foster a long term interest.

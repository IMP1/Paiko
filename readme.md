About Paiko

Taken from the [official website](http://www.paikogame.com/),
> Built to draw out the best of your intuition and tactical skill, Paiko pits you in a 
> one-on-one duel to out-build, out-position and out-maneuver your opponent with its 
> new style of turn-based strategy. Paiko is less daunting than chess but has more grit 
> than checkers, and in play feels a bit like Japanese chess meets Chinese checkers. As 
> you play, you'll find Paiko creates an engaging tactical drama with enough clarity to 
> let you create your own play style, and enough depth to foster a long term interest.

Being an amateur programmer and liking the idea of being a hobbyist game-maker, and 
stumbling across Paiko online somehow, I thought it would be cool for me to make it 
playable digitally. Having used the [LÃ–VE framework](https://love2d.org/) for lua, and 
found it just as powerful as it is easy (very), I'm using it for this project as well.

Please bear in mind that this is of yet **unfinished**. When it's finished, you won't
be able to read this sentence saying it's unfinished. That's when you'll know.
